# Two stocks portfolio analysis with Python

Two stocks minimum variance portfolio and optimum market portfolio analysis with Python using Harry Max Markowitz modern 
portfolio theory.

Libraries used for the project:
* [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

## Usage

1. Make sure to have installed the last version of all the libraries above.
2. Download and execute the "two\_stocks\_portfolio.py" file with Python (versions equal or above 3.8 are recommended).
3. First, the program will ask to introduce the ticker symbol of the 1st of the two stocks that the portfolio will be 
composed of. Introduce it and press Enter.
4. Secondly, the program will ask to introduce the ticker symbol of the 1st of the two stocks that the portfolio will be 
composed of. Introduce it and press Enter.
5. Then, the program will automatically download data from the risk-free asset and start the calculations.
6. When the calculations are complete, the program will prompt to press Enter to show results. Press it. Per stock and
portfolio stats will be presented.
7. Finally, the program will ask for a graphic representation of the portfolios in the return-risk space.
Press 'Y' to proceed, or 'N' to finish the program.
8. If graphic representation is selected, a matplotlib window will automatically appear with the plot. Here you
can zoom in, out, save the plot as an image... with the matplotlib interface. When you are finished, close the
matplotlib window and the program will end.

By default, the program uses the time period of 1 year with 1 days intervals, the 'Close' price for its calculations, 
and the risk-free asset is 10 year US bond yield (^TNX).

## Example

Use example using Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and BlackBerry Limited (BB) stocks:

```
