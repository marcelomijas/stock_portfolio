# Minimum variance and market optimal portfolio with Python

Minimum variance portfolio and market optimal portfolio finder using the packages:
- yfinance
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

Right now is only available for Python IDEs, planning to release on Windows and Linux.

Formula for the minimum variance portfolio (using Markowitz model):

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=W^*_{stock 1}=\frac{\sigma^2_{stock 2}-cov(stock 1,stock 2)}{\sigma^2_{stock 1} %2B \sigma^2_{stock 2} - 2 \times cov(stock 1, stock 2)}">

<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=W^*_{stock 2}=1-W^*_{stock 1}">

(Where <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=W^*_{i}"> equals: stock i minimum variance portfolio ponderation (i = 1, 2).
